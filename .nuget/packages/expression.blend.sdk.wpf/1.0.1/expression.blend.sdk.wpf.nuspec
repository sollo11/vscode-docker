        <description>Microsoft Expression Blend SDK includes new built-in behaviors, which are reusable pieces of packaged code that can be attached to any DependencyObject, and then fine-tuned by changing their properties. Behaviors allow you to add interactivity to your applications without having to write any code.

The Behavior API consists of three core classes: Trigger, Action and Behavior.</description>
